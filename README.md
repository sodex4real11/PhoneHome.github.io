## Project Inspiration and Technical Challenges:
PHONEHOME was inspired by a desire for continuous communication. As someone who has often faced challenges in maintaining communication with family members in the diaspora, I aimed to develop a solution that simplifies this process and offers users a convenient way to stay connected with their loved ones.

## Inspiration
The idea for PHONEHOME stemmed from personal experiences of loneliness, leading to the creation of a platform intended to serve as a centralized hub for users, providing diverse communication options.
